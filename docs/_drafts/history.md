The calligraphic stroke is the foundation for a wide a range of typographic lettershapes.

I studied calligraphy and programming at the [TypeMedia] in 2005-06. During that year I read both Gerrit Noordzij’s [The Stroke] and Donald Knuth’s [Metafont Book], as well as [Learning Python] and the [RoboFab Documentation].

During Type&Media I saw my classmate Frederik Berlaen develop [Kalliculator], a program to model calligraphic strokes around bezier skeletons, written in Python and around the UFO format. I had the chance to play with early Kalliculator prototypes.
